Short Description: Easily set expiry dates for posts and custom post types, automatically unpublishing content when it becomes outdated.

== AIT Easy Post Customization ==

AIT Easy Post Customization is a powerful yet easy-to-use plugin designed to give users control over the lifespan of their posts and custom post types by allowing you to set an expiry date. If you're managing time-sensitive content, like event announcements, special promotions, or limited-time offers, this plugin automates the process of unpublishing or archiving content, making content management hassle-free.
What problem does this plugin solve?

Manually tracking and updating expired content can be tedious and prone to errors, especially if you have a large volume of posts. Without this plugin, expired content can remain live, leading to outdated or irrelevant information on your website. AIT Easy Post Customization solves this problem by allowing you to set expiry dates on posts, ensuring that content is automatically hidden or removed after the specified date. This keeps your site fresh and up-to-date without manual intervention.
How does it improve the user experience?

    2. Custom Post Type Support: Whether you're using standard WordPress posts or custom post types (like events, job listings, products, etc.), you can easily add expiry functionality to all of them.
    3. User-Friendly Interface: The plugin integrates seamlessly with the WordPress editor, making it easy for users of all skill levels to manage expiry dates. The expiry date can be set directly from the post editing screen.

    2. Customizable Actions: Choose what happens to the post after it expires (e.g., move to draft, delete, or do nothing).
    3. Supports All Post Types: Works with standard WordPress posts and custom post types, allowing flexible use across various content types.
    4. Seamless Integration: Integrated into the post editor, making it easy to manage for both beginners and advanced users.
