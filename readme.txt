Easily set expiry dates for posts and custom post types, automatically unpublishing content when it becomes outdated.

== Description ==

AIT Easy Post Customization is a powerful yet easy-to-use plugin designed to give users control over the lifespan of their posts and custom post types by allowing you to set an expiry date. If you're managing time-sensitive content, like event announcements, special promotions, or limited-time offers, this plugin automates the process of unpublishing or archiving content, making content management hassle-free.

**What problem does this plugin solve?**

Manually tracking and updating expired content can be tedious and prone to errors, especially if you have a large volume of posts. Without this plugin, expired content can remain live, leading to outdated or irrelevant information on your website.

5. **Modern Admin Interface**: A sleek, responsive admin panel with sticky tabs, form validation, and intuitive navigation.
